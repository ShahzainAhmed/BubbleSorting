# Bubble Sorting on Strings:
### To perform bubble sort on Strings we need to compare adjacent Strings and if they are not in the order then we need to swap those strings, this process needs to be done until we reach at the end. This way all the strings will be sorted in an ascending order, this process of sorting is known as bubble sorting.
